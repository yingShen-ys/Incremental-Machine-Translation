# Weekly Updates

This document contains the weekly updates on the incremental machine translation project for the MIIS Capstone requirement.

### Work done since the final presentation in May

<ul>
    <li>
        Continued literature review on machine translation and word reordering strategies.
    </li>
    <li>Discussed with the advisor on finding more spoken language translation datasets that require word reordering besides machine translation datasets on written text.</li>
</ul>
